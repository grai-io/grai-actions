# dbt

The dbt action reads a manifest.json file inside of your github project to perform tests and update your grai instance.
Because of this, it's critical your manifest.json file is up to date on each pull request. 
One way to do this is to perform `dbt build` as part of your CI action but there are multiple ways to generate an up-to-date manifest file.

* More information about manifest.json files can be found [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json).
* Make sure to include an `- uses: actions/checkout@v3` step in your workflow so that your repo code is available.
